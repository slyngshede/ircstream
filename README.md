# IRCStream

![build](https://github.com/paravoid/ircstream/workflows/build/badge.svg)

**IRCStream** is a simple gateway to the [MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/) recent changes feed, from the IRC
protocol. It was written mainly for compatibility reasons, as there are a number of legacy clients in the wild relying
on this interface.

It presents itself as an IRC server with a restricted command set. Sending messages to channels or other
clients is not allowed. Each client is within a private namespace, unable to view messages and interact with other
connected clients, create channels, or speak on them.

Other clients are not visible on channel lists, /who etc. The sole exception is a (fake) bot user, that emits the recent
changes feed, and which is also embedded in the server (i.e. it's not a real client).

It is **not recommended** to use this gateway in new projects. Instead, Wikimedia's [EventStreams
service](https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/EventStreams) can be used, which streams recent changes in JSON using a
well defined schema and over the SSE protocol.

# Usage

The software requires a configuration file, `ircstream.conf`. An example file is provided with this distribution and
should be self-explanatory.

The server has been designed to be as cloud-native as an IRC server can be. It exposes metrics over the
[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) protocol, logs to `stdout`, and can optionally log in JSON as well, using a
structured format to allow easy ingestion into modern log pipelines.

In the experimental SSE mode, it ingests events over the EventStreams service (`stream.wikimedia.org`) formats them
using the existing legacy format and emits them to IRC clients. It is suitable for running in any environment, as it has
no further requirements beyond internet access.

In RC2UDP mode, it requires messages to be broadcast over UDP to a specified port using the so-called `RC2UDP` protocol:
each UDP message is expected to be a channel name, followed by a tab character, followed by the message to be sent to
all clients. This mode is suitable for running in a production environment, alongside MediaWiki.

# History

The idea for this project was originally conceived in November 2016 internally at the Wikimedia Foundation, as a
response to ongoing difficulties with the deprecation of the `irc.wikimedia.org` gateway. It was developed on and off
for a few years, and saw its first release in May 2020, as part of a renewed effort to [migrate the internal
architecture to EventStreams' backend](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T234234).

# Requirements

Python 3.11+, plus the following modules from PyPI or your distribution:

* `prometheus_client`
* `structlog`

You can use `pip install .` to install the package into the standard location of your system, which will install
an executable in a standard binary location, such as /usr/bin or /bin. Alternatively, provided the necessary libraries
above have already been installed, one can execute `python3 -m ircstream` to run directly from the cloned source tree.
